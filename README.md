# Most Annoying Cookie Consent
The "Most Annoying Cookie Consent" ever. I took this Javascript learning project from Scrimba and re-coded the JS from scratch. You can see in the notes in index.js what I attempted to create from memory based on what I had learned. 
 
 Please note: the styling and copy in this are mostly Scrimba's. I added a few touches here and there as was necessary to complete the Javascript.
